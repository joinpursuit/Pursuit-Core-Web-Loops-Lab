## Exercises

1. Write a `while` loop and a `for` loop that takes the variable "num" and logs all the numbers, descending, between "num" and 1.

2. Write a `while` loop and a `for` loop that takes the variable "max", and iterates over all numbers from 0 to "max".
For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and log that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even")

3. Write a `while` loop and a `for` loop that takes the variable "x" and iterates over all numbers from 0 to "x".
For each iteration of the loop, it will multiply the number of "x" by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").
  _Bonus_ think of another way to solve it.

4. Write code that prints/logs all the numbers that end in a 5 from 1 to 100, **exclusive**.

5. Without running/executing your code, how many times will the loop below run? Explain why.

```js
let i = 5;

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}

// Your explanation here
```

6. Write a loop that uses console.log to log all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, log "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), log "Buzz" instead.

7. Modify your program to log "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (still log "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

### Bonus:

1. Write a program that would log the [lyrics of the song 99 Bottles of Beer](http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/lyrics.html). This is the first verse of the song:

  ```
  99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
  Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.
  ```

  This verse is repeated, each time with one less bottle, until the number of bottles is 0. When the number of bottles is 2, the verse is:

  ```
  2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.
  Take one down, pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.
  ```

  In the last line, the word bottles (plural), is  replaced with bottle (singular)

  When the number of bottles is 1, the verse is:

  ```
  1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
  Take one down, pass it around, No more bottle of beer on the wall.
  ```

2. Use the `assignGrade` function (given below). Write a function that logs each number from 60 - 100 along with its corresponding letter score.
Exp For each number from 81 to 90, log B, like so:

```js
60 - F
...
81 - B
82 - B
83 - B
...
93 - A
94 - A
...
```

```js
function assignGrade(score) {
    if (score > 90) {
        return 'A';
    } else if (score > 80) {
        return 'B';
    } else if (score > 70) {
        return 'C';
    } else if (score > 65) {
        return 'D';
    } else {
        return 'F';
    };
};
```

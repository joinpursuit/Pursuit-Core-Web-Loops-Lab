Class Notes:

//LOOPS!
While loop and For loop
//Allow us to repeat blocks of code.
Initialization

Condition while true continue
code block
step towards ending the condition



//lets pretend I wanted to print to the console all the numbers from 1-10
const printOneToTen =() => {
  console.log(1)
  console.log(2)
  console.log(3)...
}

Intialization:
const printOneToTen = () => {
  let num = 1;
  while (num <= 10)
  console.log (num);
  num  +=1;
}
printOneToTen();

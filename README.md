## Exercises

## Problem One 

a. Write a `while` loop that takes the variable `num` and logs all the numbers, descending, between "num" and 1

let num = 100
while (num >=1) {
    console.log(num)
    num -=1
}

b. Write a `for` loop that takes the variable `num` and logs all the numbers, descending, between "num" and 1

let num = 100
for (num = 100; num>0; num-=1){
    console.log(num)
}

Example:

```js
let num = 8

// Your code here

/* Logs:
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
*/
```

## Problem Two

a. Write a `while` loop that takes the variable "max", and iterates over all numbers from 0 to "max". 
For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and log that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even")

b. Use a `for` loop instead

Example: 

```js
let max = 3

// Your code here

/* Logs:
"0 is even"
"1 is odd"
"2 is even"
"3 is odd"
*/

```

## Problem Three

a. Write a `while` loop that takes the variable "x" and iterates over all numbers from 0 to "x". For each iteration of the loop, it will multiply the number of "x" by 9 and log the result 

b. Use a `for` loop instead.

Example:

```js
let x = 5

// Your code here

/* Logs:
"0 * 9 = 0"
"1 * 9 = 9"
"2 * 9 = 18"
"3 * 9 = 27"
"4 * 9 = 36"
"5 * 9 = 45"
*/
```


Write a `while` loop and a `for` loop that takes the variable "x" and iterates over all numbers from 0 to "x". For each iteration of the loop, it will multiply the number of "x" by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").


## Problem Four

Write code that prints/logs all the numbers that end in a 5 from 1 to 100, **exclusive**.

## Problem Five

Without running/executing your code, how many times will the loop below run? Explain why.

```js
let i = 5;

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}

// Your explanation here
```

## Problem Six

Write a loop that uses console.log to log all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, log "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), log "Buzz" instead.

## Problem Seven

Modify your program to log "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (still log "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

## Problem Eight

Write a program that would log the [lyrics of the song 99 Bottles of Beer](http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/lyrics.html). This is the first verse of the song:

  ```
  99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
  Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.
  ```

This verse is repeated, each time with one less bottle, until the number of bottles is 0. When the number of bottles is 2, the verse is:

  ```
  2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.
  Take one down, pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.
  ```

  In the last line, the word bottles (plural), is  replaced with bottle (singular)

  When the number of bottles is 1, the verse is:

  ```
  1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
  Take one down, pass it around, No more bottle of beer on the wall.
  ```

## Problem Nine

Given an integer N draw a square of N x N asterisks. Look at the examples.

Example 1:
Input: `let N = 2`

Output:
```js
**
**
```

Example 2:
Input: `let N = 3`

Output:
```js

## Problem Ten

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
